## Jenkins Installation - 2 types
```
 1. Install through internet.
 2. Install using Package Manager(YUM)

**Note:** 
  1. pre-request is jdk(java develoment kit) to be installed before Jenkins.
  2. Java compiler(javac) should be worked fine.
```

## Jenkins Installation(Using Package Manager - YUM):
```
 1. connect to Linux machine using putty/mobaxterm. 
 2. go to the following location in browser
 https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/
 3. click on Red Hat/CentOS
 4. execute the commands which are under Long Term Support release on Linux machine one by one
 5. sudo systemctl start jenkins (start Jenkins)
 6. sudo systemctl enable jenkins (adding jenkins service to start up automatically on boot up 
 7. sudo systemctl status jenkins (check the service status it should be in running)
 8. Access the jenkins using web client(firefox, chrome etc)(http://IPaddress:8080)
 9. get the password and paste accordingly.
 10. Install suggested plugins.
 11. provide username as jenkins and other relavent details.
 12. Finally, you will see Jenkins Home Page.

**Note:** 
# Add jenkins user to wheel group with the following command.
  usermod -aG wheel jenkins

# Open the /etc/sudoers file
  sudo vi /etc/sudoers

# find the below line and uncomment it.
  %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
```

```
---
## nginx installation

```
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx

Note: Instead of yum repository we need to use amazon-linux-extras package manager to install nginx on amazon linux distribution.

## Install Tomcat using internet (source)
```
** Install JAVA **
# install java if it is already not installed on linux
  sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
  
# check java version
  java -version

** Install Tomcat **
# cd /usr/local
# sudo wget http://www-us.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.41/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.41.tar.gz
# tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.41.tar.gz
# mv apache-tomcat-9.0.41 tomcat9

** Create a User to run Tomcat under systemd **
# useradd -r tomcat

# Give permissions and ownership rights to the Tomcat installation directory.
 chown -R tomcat:tomcat /usr/local/tomcat9
 
** Next, create a tomcat.service unit file under /etc/systemd/system/ directory using VI editor. **
   vi /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service
  
# Copy and paste the following configuration in the tomcat.service file.
   
   [Unit]
   Description=Apache Tomcat Server
   After=syslog.target network.target

   [Service]
   Type=forking
   User=tomcat
   Group=tomcat

   Environment=CATALINA_PID=/usr/local/tomcat9/temp/tomcat.pid
   Environment=CATALINA_HOME=/usr/local/tomcat9
   Environment=CATALINA_BASE=/usr/local/tomcat9

   ExecStart=/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/catalina.sh start
   ExecStop=/usr/local/tomcat9/bin/catalina.sh stop

   RestartSec=10
   Restart=always
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
  
# Save the file reload the systemd configuration to apply the recent changes using the following command.
  systemctl daemon-reload
  
** Start Tomcat **
# Then start the tomcat service, enable it to auto-start at system boot and check the status using the following commands.
  # systemctl start tomcat.service
  # systemctl enable tomcat.service
  # systemctl status tomcat.service
  
Note: Tomcat uses port 8080 and 8443 for HTTP and HTTPS requests respectively.

** Access the Tomcat Server using web client(web browser) **
   http://IP:8080
   
** Specify the Users for Manager GUI Page and Admin Page Access. **
#  Finally we need to create user accounts to secure and access admin/manager pages. Edit /usr/local/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml file in your editor and paste inside <tomcat-users> </tomcat-users> tags.

   <!-- user admin can access manager and admin section both -->
   <role rolename="manager-gui,manager-script"/>
   <user username="deployer" password="tomcat123" roles="manager-gui,manager-script"/>
   
** Enable Remote Access to Tomcat Manager and Host Manager**
# By default, access to the Manager and Host Manager apps is restricted to the localhost, the server on which Tomcat is installed and running. But you can enable remote access to a       specific IP address or network e.g your LAN.

# To enable remote access to the Manager app, open and edit the configuration file /usr/local/tomcat9/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml.
  vi /usr/local/tomcat9/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
  
  Then look for the following line.
   allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 />
  
  allow tomcat access from any host or network.
   allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 |.*" />
   
 ** Restart Tomcat Service **
   systemctl restart tomcat.service
   
 ```

## Create web application (no compile) deployment Job in Jenkins for tomcat
```
**SCM:**
  url: https://gitlab.com/chinnu1028/javawebapp.git
  branch: master

**ExecuteShell**
  mkdir /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/javaapp
  sudo chmod 777 /us/local/tomcat/webapps/javaapp
  cp -Rf myapp/* /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/javaapp
  sudo systemctl restart tomcat
  
  Note: Access the deployed application using the url http://IP:8080/javaapp
```
---
## Create web application (with compile) deployment Job in Jenkins for tomcat
```
**SCM:**
  url: https://gitlab.com/chinnu1028/maven-project2.git
  branch: master

**Invoke top-level Maven targets**
  Maven Version: maven1
  Goals: clean package

**ExecuteShell**
  cp -Rf webapp/target/portal.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/
  sudo systemctl restart tomcat

Note: 1. maven should be installed using internet source and add to Jenkins --> manage jenkins --> Global Tools Configuration as maven1.
      2. Note: Access the deployed application using the url http://IP:8080/portal
```

## Build Pipeline
```
1. install "Build Pipeline" Plugin
2. Go to QA
 - New View or "+" symbol
 - select Build Pipeline
 - select initial step
 - save
3. add other job
 - go to initial job
 - post build actions
 - select "Build other projects"
 - select the job
 - save
```
---
## Pipelines Practice

**Scripted Pipeline**
```
# create a sample pipeline using shell commands

# create a pipeline for html web application deployment to httpd web server

# create a pipeline for html web application deployment to NGINX web server

# create a pipeline for Java web application (without compile) deployment (Execute shell) to tomcat application server

# create a pipeline for Java web application (with compile) deployment (Execute shell) to tomcat application server

# create a pipeline for Java web application (with compile) deployment (Jenkins plugin - deploy to war/ear container) to tomcat application server

# create a pipeline for Java web application (with compile) deployment (Maven plugin - tomcat7:deploy) to tomcat application server
```

**Declarative Pipeline**
```
# create a sample pipeline using shell commands

# create a pipeline for html web application deployment to httpd web server

# create a pipeline for html web application deployment to NGINX web server

# create a pipeline for Java web application (without compile) deployment (Execute shell) to tomcat application server

# create a pipeline for Java web application (with compile) deployment (Execute shell) to tomcat application server

# create a pipeline for Java web application (with compile) deployment (Jenkins plugin - deploy to war/ear container) to tomcat application server

# create a pipeline for Java web application (with compile) deployment (Maven plugin - tomcat7:deploy) to tomcat application server
```

**NOTE:** 
```
# "Pipeline" plugin for scripted and declarative pipelines will be installed by default whenever we install jenkins.
# if any doubts, please refer the following jenkins url
  http://52.87.182.2:8082/job/QA/
  username: jenkins
  password: Password123
```
